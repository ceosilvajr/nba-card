# NBA Player Card Generator 🏀

## Overview
This project is part of my Python learning journey through [Codedex.io](https://www.codedex.io). It's an interactive command-line application that generates detailed player cards for NBA players using AI analysis and saves them as PDF files.

## What I Learned 📚
Through this project and the Codedex Python course, I've gained practical experience with:

- **Python Fundamentals**
  - Variables and Data Types
  - Control Flow (if statements, loops)
  - Functions and Modules
  - Error Handling
  - String Manipulation

- **External Libraries**
  - Working with AI APIs
  - PDF Creation
  - Data Processing

- **User Interaction**
  - Command Line Interface
  - Input Validation
  - User Experience Design

## Features 🌟
- Interactive command-line interface
- AI-powered player analysis
- PDF report generation
- Error handling and input validation

## How to Use 🚀
1. Run the program using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Enter 'Y' when prompted to create a new NBA player card
3. Type the name of any NBA player
4. The program will generate an AI analysis and save it as a PDF

## Project Structure 📁
- `main.py`: Main program entry point and user interface
- `nba_player_card.py`: Handles player analysis generation
- `save_to_pdf.py`: Manages PDF creation and formatting

## Dependencies 📦
- Python 3.9
- Required libraries 
  - Run:`pip install openai`
  - Run:`pip install python-dotenv`
  - Run:`pip install reportlab`

## Future Improvements 🔮
- Add player statistics integration
- Include player images in the PDF
- Implement batch processing for multiple players
- Add more detailed analysis categories

## Acknowledgments 🙏
- Thanks to Codedex.io for providing an excellent Python learning platform
